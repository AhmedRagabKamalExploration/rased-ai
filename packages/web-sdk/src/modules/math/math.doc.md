Math Fingerprinting Module
🔬 The Research and "Why" Behind Mathematical Fingerprinting
The core idea behind math-based fingerprinting is that the implementation of floating-point arithmetic and trigonometric functions can vary subtly across different combinations of hardware (CPU, GPU), operating systems, and browser versions. These minute, predictable differences create a unique, stable, and difficult-to-forge device fingerprint.

🧮 Mathematical Variations
💻 Hardware Level
CPU: Floating-point units (FPUs) in different CPUs may have slightly different internal precision or rounding behaviors for complex operations.

GPU: The shader and graphics pipelines on different GPUs have their own unique floating-point implementations. This is a crucial source of entropy.

💾 Software Stack
Operating System: The OS's math libraries (e.g., libm on Unix-like systems) can have different implementations and optimization levels.

Browser Engine: Different JavaScript engines (V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, JavaScriptCore in Safari) and their specific versions can handle complex math operations with slight variations in precision.

🧪 Advanced Implementation Strategy
A simple math operation won't be enough to create a unique fingerprint. The strategy is to chain together a series of complex, deterministic mathematical calculations that amplify these minor differences into a detectable fingerprint. The process is as follows:

Generate a Deterministic Input: The module starts with a fixed, known input value.

Chain Complex Operations: The input is passed through a sequence of operations that are highly sensitive to floating-point precision. This includes:

Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)

Exponential and logarithmic functions (exp, log, pow)

Square roots and other high-precision operations

Bitwise manipulations

Aggregate the Result: The final result of this complex chain is a single numerical value.

Hash the Output: The final number is then converted to a string and hashed (e.g., using SHA-256) to produce a stable and compact fingerprint.

This process is entirely stateless and provides a unique identifier of the system's core mathematical capabilities without any network requests or user interaction.
