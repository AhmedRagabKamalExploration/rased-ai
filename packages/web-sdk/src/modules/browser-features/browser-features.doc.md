# Browser Features Module

## 🔬 The Research and "Why" Behind Feature Detection

The core idea behind feature-based fingerprinting is that every browser and rendering engine, in combination with its operating system, has a unique set of supported capabilities. By testing for the presence of a wide array of features—from storage APIs to HTML5 elements and CSS properties—we can create a highly detailed and stable fingerprint of the user's browser environment.

## 🕵️ Feature Sets as a Signal

The specific combination of supported features is much harder to spoof than a simple User-Agent string. A bot or fraudster may successfully change its User-Agent to mimic Chrome on macOS, but it's much more difficult to ensure that all of its underlying feature support perfectly matches that profile.

## 🚩 Anti-Fraud and Bot Detection

- **Uniqueness**: The vast number of potential feature combinations creates a high-entropy fingerprint. This makes it a powerful tool for distinguishing between individual devices.

- **Consistency**: The feature set of a browser is relatively stable. This allows the backend to reliably recognize a returning user over time.

- **Bot Detection**: Headless browsers (like Puppeteer or Playwright) often have different or incomplete support for certain features. For example, they may not support WebGL or advanced audio APIs, which is a strong signal of a non-human user.

- **Spoofing**: An attacker trying to spoof a device would need to ensure that the browser's feature set is internally consistent. If the User-Agent claims to be a modern browser but a check for a standard ES6 feature fails, this inconsistency is a major red flag.

## 🎛️ Implementation Strategy

The module's implementation is based on a structured approach that categorizes feature checks into logical groups, as seen in your payload: storage, html5, es, graphics, network, css, and misc.

- **Feature Probing**: The module performs a series of boolean checks to see if a particular API, property, or capability exists in the current browser environment.

- **Binary Encoding**: The result of each check is stored as a 1 (supported), 0 (not supported), or null (not applicable or an error occurred). This creates a compact binary-like representation of the browser's capabilities.

- **Categorization**: The results are grouped by category (e.g., html5, css). This structured data is then dispatched as a single event for efficient backend processing.

## 📤 Output/Send Events to Backend

### 🚀 Event Transmission Format

The browser-features module sends events to the backend in the following structure:

```typescript
// Individual event sent to backend
interface BrowserFeaturesBackendEvent {
  eventType: ""fingerprint.browser-features" | "browser-features.error"";
  payload: BrowserFeaturesData | BrowserFeaturesError;
  timestamp: number; // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
}
```

### 📦 Batch Event Structure

Events are sent as part of a batch to the backend API endpoint `POST /v1/event`:

```typescript
interface EventBatch {
  deviceId: string; // Unique device identifier
  batchId: string; // Unique batch identifier
  batchTimestamp: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
  modules: {
    browser-features: BrowserFeaturesBackendEvent[]; // Array of browser-features events
    // ... other module events
  };
}
```

### 🎯 Expected Backend Properties

The backend expects and stores the following properties for browser-features events:

#### Database Schema (events table)
```sql
{
  "id": "unique-event-id",
  "transaction_id": "txn-xxx",
  "organization_id": "org-xxx", 
  "session_id": "ssn-xxx",
  "device_id": "device-xxx",
  "batch_id": "batch-xxx",
  "event_type": "fingerprint.browser-features", // or other browser-features event types
  "payload": {
    /* browser-features specific data structure */
  },
  "received_at": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### BrowserFeatures Event Example
```json
{
  "eventType": "fingerprint.browser-features",
  "payload": {
    /* Example payload data */
  },
  "timestamp": 1642248000000
}
```

### 🔄 Event Processing Flow

1. **Collection**: Module collects browser-features data during initialization
2. **Analysis**: Advanced analysis performed on collected data
3. **Event Creation**: Creates event with proper structure and timestamp
4. **Batching**: Event added to current batch with other module events
5. **Transmission**: Batch sent to backend via `POST /v1/event`
6. **Storage**: Backend stores individual events in database
7. **Analysis**: Events can be queried and analyzed for fraud detection

### 📊 Backend Event Validation

The backend validates incoming browser-features events against these requirements:

- ✅ `eventType` must be valid browser-features event type
- ✅ `payload` must contain required fields based on event type
- ✅ `timestamp` must be valid Unix timestamp
- ✅ All required fields must be present and valid
- ✅ Data types must match expected schema


### 🏗️ Event Structure

```typescript
interface BrowserFeaturesEvent {
  eventId: string;
  eventType: "browserFeatures" | "browserFeatures.error";
  moduleName: "browserFeatures";
  timestamp: string;
  payload: BrowserFeaturesData | BrowserFeaturesError;
}
```

### 📋 Data Structures

#### ✅ Successful Generation (`browserFeatures`)

```typescript
interface BrowserFeaturesData {
  storage: (0 | 1 | null)[];
  html5: (0 | 1 | null)[];
  es: (0 | 1 | null)[];
  graphics: (0 | 1 | null)[];
  network: (0 | 1 | null)[];
  css: (0 | 1 | null)[];
  misc: (0 | 1 | null)[];
}
```

#### ❌ Error Response (`browserFeatures.error`)

```typescript
interface BrowserFeaturesError {
  error: string;
  errorCode: "COLLECTION_FAILED" | "UNEXPECTED_ERROR";
  details: {
    message: string;
  };
}
```

Privacy Mode Detection: Some features may be disabled in private browsing
Anti-Fingerprinting Detection: Detects if certain features are being blocked 7. Key Insights from the Data
Looking at the actual data from your payload:
Storage: Mixed support (0,1,0,1,0,1,1) - suggests some storage APIs are blocked
HTML5: Mostly supported with some gaps - indicates a modern browser
ES: All features supported - suggests modern JavaScript engine
Graphics: All features supported - indicates good graphics capabilities
Network: Mostly supported with 2 blocked features - suggests some network restrictions
CSS: Mostly supported with some gaps - indicates modern CSS support
Misc: Mixed support - suggests some APIs are blocked or unavailable
