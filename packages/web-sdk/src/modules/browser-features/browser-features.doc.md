Browser Features Module
🔬 The Research and "Why" Behind Feature Detection
The core idea behind feature-based fingerprinting is that every browser and rendering engine, in combination with its operating system, has a unique set of supported capabilities. By testing for the presence of a wide array of features—from storage APIs to HTML5 elements and CSS properties—we can create a highly detailed and stable fingerprint of the user's browser environment.

🕵️ Feature Sets as a Signal
The specific combination of supported features is much harder to spoof than a simple User-Agent string. A bot or fraudster may successfully change its User-Agent to mimic Chrome on macOS, but it's much more difficult to ensure that all of its underlying feature support perfectly matches that profile.

🚩 Anti-Fraud and Bot Detection
Uniqueness: The vast number of potential feature combinations creates a high-entropy fingerprint. This makes it a powerful tool for distinguishing between individual devices.

Consistency: The feature set of a browser is relatively stable. This allows the backend to reliably recognize a returning user over time.

Bot Detection: Headless browsers (like Puppeteer or Playwright) often have different or incomplete support for certain features. For example, they may not support WebGL or advanced audio APIs, which is a strong signal of a non-human user.

Spoofing: An attacker trying to spoof a device would need to ensure that the browser's feature set is internally consistent. If the User-Agent claims to be a modern browser but a check for a standard ES6 feature fails, this inconsistency is a major red flag.

🎛️ Implementation Strategy
The module's implementation is based on a structured approach that categorizes feature checks into logical groups, as seen in your payload: storage, html5, es, graphics, network, css, and misc.

Feature Probing: The module performs a series of boolean checks to see if a particular API, property, or capability exists in the current browser environment.

Binary Encoding: The result of each check is stored as a 1 (supported), 0 (not supported), or null (not applicable or an error occurred). This creates a compact binary-like representation of the browser's capabilities.

Categorization: The results are grouped by category (e.g., html5, css). This structured data is then dispatched as a single event for efficient backend processing.

📊 Technical Implementation and Data Indicators
🏗️ Event Structure
interface BrowserFeaturesEvent {
eventId: string;
eventType: "browserFeatures" | "browserFeatures.error";
moduleName: "browserFeatures";
timestamp: string;
payload: BrowserFeaturesData | BrowserFeaturesError;
}

📋 Data Structures
✅ Successful Generation (browserFeatures)
interface BrowserFeaturesData {
storage: (0 | 1 | null)[];
html5: (0 | 1 | null)[];
es: (0 | 1 | null)[];
graphics: (0 | 1 | null)[];
network: (0 | 1 | null)[];
css: (0 | 1 | null)[];
misc: (0 | 1 | null)[];
}

❌ Error Response (browserFeatures.error)
interface BrowserFeaturesError {
error: string;
errorCode: "COLLECTION_FAILED" | "UNEXPECTED_ERROR";
details: {
message: string;
};
}
